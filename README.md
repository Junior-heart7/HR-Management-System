A “human resource category” (for example, consultant, programmer, etc.) is a way of classifying skills that is useful in matching resource requirements to particular people when developing the human resource plan for a project. The Human resource plan contains for each human resource category, information such as:

• The number of staff required.
• Costing information and assumptions.
• When the staff are needed and for how long.
• Any special skills required over and above those that people in the category would normally be expected to have, as well as the required level of proficiency and the relative     importance of these skills.
• Training requirements needed specifically for the project, for example in a new technology.
• Office and materiel requirements
• Plans for team-building activities. (Motivation management)

The following column shows a sample portion of the Human resource plan for a project.

►	Human Resource Category
►	Number of staff
►	Cost assumptions
►	When needed
►	Till what date the staff is needed
►	Special skills, if any
►	Special needs, if any
►	Training needs, if any
►	Office and material equipment


The Human Resource Plan supports staff planning, staff acquisition, allocating resources to staff, and supervising project specific training activities. A summary Human resource plan is created for the entire project and managed by the project manager.
The formality with which the Human resource plan is created and documented is a reflection of the size and complexity of the project. Typically, small projects do not require a formal plan. On the other hand, large, multiyear, multilevel projects with many participants may require multiple formal plans. The HRM plan is based on the project schedule.
